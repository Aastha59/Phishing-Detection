# Phishing-Detection
Phishing detection identifies and blocks fraudulent attempts to steal sensitive information, using methods like machine learning, URL analysis, and behavioral monitoring to enhance security and protect user data.
Project Title
Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based approach to detect phishing websites. It processes a dataset of URLs and associated features, applies feature engineering techniques, and trains multiple classifiers to identify phishing attempts effectively.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Encoding labels, handling missing values, and stemming text data.
Machine Learning Models: Implements models such as KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and MLP for classification.
Text Vectorization: Utilizes TF-IDF for converting text data into numerical features.
Metrics: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance.
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, nltk, imblearn
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detection.git
cd phishing-detection
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset and place it in the project folder.
Usage
Run the Python script to preprocess data and train models:
python phishing_detection.py
Access the frontend via the frontend.html file for a web-based interface.
